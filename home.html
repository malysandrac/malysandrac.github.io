<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>	Hello,  My name is Sandra.  I am bilingual in English and Spanish.  Because of this upbringing, I am very adept at working with multiple types of people in different languages and getting my point across.  I am very much a people person and enjoy interacting with everyone around me.  I enjoy the challenge of using my abilities and skills to expand my knowledge and capabilities.
I believe that in giving respect, you get it back.  I also believe in giving my best in any situation I am in.  These qualities reflect in my work and attitude.</p>
